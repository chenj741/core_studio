<h1> Userflow/Microinteraction</h1>
<p> Community goodwill app that allows people in a neighborhood to provide and support each other during hard times. The app allows people to acquire things that they don't have access to, especially during quaratine.</p>

<p id="smaller"> What sets this app as a unique platform is the ability to merge requests between users as well as the time limits on interactions, making the interactions focused on action.

	More microinteractions:
	When giving or receiving thanks, confetti pops out
	Location validation when joining a community
	Small timer for posts

<div id="two" class="content">
<h1>Ideation/Userflow</h1>
<p> For ideation, I made a simple userflow linking the different pages of the web application.</p>
<p id="smaller"> Along with the userflow, the ideation included an introduction page of the definition of kangaroo words, a complete list of the words, filters, and individual pages for each type of word. </p>

<div id="three" class="content"> 
	<h1> Wireflows</h1>
	<p> I worked on the visual language of the prototype to make sure that the colors could work with the concept.</p>
		<br><br>
		<p id="smaller">New pages to introduce the concept of Kangaroo words were added.</p>

<div id="four" class="content"> 
	<h1> Working Prototype </h1>
	<p>Project was coded with different usages of css grid and flexbox, using the high fidelity as a reference. d3.js was used to implement the values for the catalogue. During this process, I was able to learn how to utilize flexbox and css grid to make components and to place them on a page. Working with d3.js was a struggle, however, as the way I formatted my .csv created issues.</p>
