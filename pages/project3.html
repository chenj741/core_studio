<h1> Userflow/Microinteraction</h1>

<div id="four" class="content"> 
	<h1> Working Prototype </h1>
	<p>Project was coded with different usages of css grid and flexbox, using the high fidelity as a reference. d3.js was used to implement the values for the catalogue. During this process, I was able to learn how to utilize flexbox and css grid to make components and to place them on a page. Working with d3.js was a struggle, however, as the way I formatted my .csv created issues.</p>
