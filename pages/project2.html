<div id="one" class="content"> 
<h1> Catalogue Content </h1>
<p> For my catalogue content, I looked into Kangaroo words, which are words that contain their synonym with the same sequence of letters. I wanted to create an interactive website for a topic with multiple aspects, so kangaroo words were perfect. Also, I love kangaroos. </p>
<p id="smaller">
I put the 300+ known kangaroo words into a spreadsheet with their definitions. These were distinguished with a few filters. These included anti-kangaroo words- words that contain their antonyms. Both- words that contain both a synonym and an antonym. Second Joeys- words that contain two synonyms. and Grand Kangaroos- words that have a synonym within their synonym so that all three words are synonyms.</p>

<div id="two" class="content">
<h1>Ideation/Userflow</h1>
<p> For ideation, I made a simple userflow linking the different pages of the web application.</p>
<p id="smaller"> Along with the userflow, the ideation included an introduction page of the definition of kangaroo words, a complete list of the words, filters, and individual pages for each type of word. </p>

	<h1> Wireflows v2 </h1>
	<p> We overconsume products that are unecessary and wasteful, which fuels demand and the vicious cycle of harm towards the environment. Pollution of air, land, and sea can be reduced with anti consumption or minimalism.</p>
		<br><br>
		<p id="smaller">This is a tracking app that allows users to input products that they wish to buy, and points out whether a similar item can be bought secondhand, if the product cannot be recycled, or if there is a greener or local alternative. Preventitive, rather than mitigative measures are encouraged.

		This app aims to educate users about environmental harm that products can cause and discourage unecessary spending.

<div id="six" class="content"> 
	<h1> High Fidelity Prototype and User Testing </h1>
	<p>The high fidelity prototype built off of paper prototypes features a simple interface with a main dock and search bar on most pages. The app revolves around the user's profile, which is the main branch of the pathways. </p>
		<p>User testing of the prototype revealed that certain elements were unclear in their function and that some functions needed additional explanations.
