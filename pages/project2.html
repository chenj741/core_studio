<div id="one" class="content"> 
<h1> Catalogue Content </h1>
<p> For my catalogue content, I looked into Kangaroo words, which are words that contain their synonym with the same sequence of letters. I wanted to create an interactive website for a topic with multiple aspects, so kangaroo words were perfect. Also, I love kangaroos. </p>
<p id="smaller">
I put the 300+ known kangaroo words into a spreadsheet with their definitions. These were distinguished with a few filters. These included anti-kangaroo words- words that contain their antonyms. Both- words that contain both a synonym and an antonym. Second Joeys- words that contain two synonyms. and Grand Kangaroos- words that have a synonym within their synonym so that all three words are synonyms.</p>

<div id="two" class="content">
<h1>Ideation/Userflow</h1>
<p> For ideation, I made a simple userflow linking the different pages of the web application.</p>
<p id="smaller"> Along with the userflow, the ideation included an introduction page of the definition of kangaroo words, a complete list of the words, filters, and individual pages for each type of word. </p>

<div id="five" class="content"> 
	<h1> Working Prototype </h1>
	<p>Project was coded with different usages of css grid and flexbox, using the high fidelity as a reference. d3.js was used to implement the values for the catalogue. During this process, I was able to learn how to utilize flexbox and css grid to make components and to place them on a page. Working with d3.js was a struggle, however, as the way I formatted my .csv created issues.</p>
